# Airbnb Website Clone Project

Welcome to my Airbnb website clone project! This project was created with the aim of allowing me to practice my HTML and CSS skills by recreating certain features and visual aspects of the popular lodging reservation site.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the basic concepts of web development, including structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS. By reproducing certain parts of the Airbnb website, I will learn how to implement complex layouts, style user interface elements, and make the site responsive across different screen sizes.

## Project Contents

This project will include several steps, including:

- Structuring the content of the homepage using appropriate HTML elements such as <header>, <main>, <footer>, etc.
- Styling the layout using CSS techniques such as selectors, flexbox or grid layout properties, and media queries to make it adaptive.
- Integrating interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and links to create a seamless user experience.
- Adding images and media to enhance the visual appearance of the site.

## How to Contribute

While this project is primarily intended for my own learning efforts, I am open to suggestions, bug fixes, and improvements proposed by other developers. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the developer community and the numerous online resources that have helped me learn and progress in my web development skills.
